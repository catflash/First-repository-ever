		<p class="float" lang="en"><b>Batman</b> is a fictional superhero appearing in <i>American comic books</i> published by <a class="comics" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_Comics" title="DC Comics">DC Comics</a>. The character was created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger, and first appeared in Detective Comics #27 (May 1939). Originally named "the Bat-Man", the character is also referred to by such epithets as the "Caped Crusader", the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Knight_(nickname)" title="Dark Knight">Dark Knight</a>, and the "World's Greatest Detective". Batman's secret identity is Bruce Wayne, an American billionaire, playboy, philanthropist, and capitalist. He is the owner and chairman of Wayne Enterprises. Having witnessed the murder of his parents as a child, he swore revenge on criminals, an oath tempered with a sense of justice. Wayne trains himself both physically and intellectually and crafts a bat-inspired persona to fight crime. Batman operates in the fictional Gotham City and is assisted by various supporting characters, including his butler Alfred, the police commissioner Jim Gordon, and vigilante allies such as Robin. Unlike most superheroes, Batman does not possess any superpowers; he makes use of his genius intellect, physical prowess, martial arts skills, detective skills, science and technology, vast wealth, provocation of fear and intimidation, and an indomitable will in his continuous war on crime. A large assortment of villains make up Batman's rogues gallery, including his archenemy the Joker.</p>
